# Milestone 1 Summary - MCP Package Development

## Accomplishments

We have successfully completed the first milestone of our JobStash MCP integration project:

1. **Project Setup**
   - Created a monorepo structure with workspace configuration
   - Set up TypeScript configuration
   - Configured testing framework with Jest
   - Created project documentation

2. **MCP Package Development**
   - Researched and implemented the Model Context Protocol standard
   - Created a dedicated MCP package with:
     - Type definitions for job search parameters
     - Server implementation using the official MCP SDK
     - Integration with OpenAI for processing queries
     - Prompt engineering for job search extraction
     - Error handling and validation

3. **Testing & Tools**
   - Developed unit tests for the MCP package
   - Created a CLI demo tool for testing
   - Implemented a test client for interacting with the MCP server

## Current Functionality

The MCP package can now:
- Parse natural language job search queries
- Extract structured parameters like:
  - Job roles/titles
  - Required skills
  - Experience levels
  - Remote preferences
  - Location preferences
  - Salary expectations
- Return structured data that can be used to query the JobStash API
- Handle errors gracefully

## How to Demo

1. Set your OpenAI API key:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

2. Run the demo script with a job search query:
   ```bash
   ./demo.sh "Looking for a senior Solidity developer role in a remote position"
   ```

## Next Steps

Moving on to Milestone 2, we will:
1. Create a server application that integrates with the JobStash API
2. Connect the MCP package to the server
3. Implement real job searches based on processed queries
4. Create a complete end-to-end demo

## Feedback and Lessons Learned

- Using the official MCP SDK simplified implementation
- The modular approach provides good separation of concerns
- Proper typing with zod ensures robust validation
- The architecture is extensible for future requirements like CV parsing
