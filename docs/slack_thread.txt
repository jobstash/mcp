Im tired of this dude getting attention for what essentially is a shitty agency

@Eliane
 any question on your end?

@Matheus Pagani
 anything we should clarify?

Hello 
@David
 we're starting to digest the info and study the figma today. Expect more questions down the week as we go through hehehe

@David
 let's do it, just need to understand what to do exactly :grin:


David

nice.
So, the guy thinks that building a telegram native ui is cool.
lets prove him wrong :slightly_smiling_face:

imo what’s needed is that when the user puts in a bigass string it suggests as the first item in the overlay to parse that with AI
5:14
and if the user inputs a CV, it should offer the same

you saw this ui in function on EV right 
@defuera
?

https://ecosystem.vision/
ecosystem.visionecosystem.vision
Ecosystem Vision
Explore and visualize grants and ecosystem trends with actionable insights.
5:16
go here, and search for anything
5:17
the overlay that pops up is where we can go and provide the search experience we want
5:17
i think of that overlay as a sort of routing UI to direct users towards the thing/entity type they want to find
5:18

@John
 is still fucked btw

@Temi
 if you know anything about that?


defuera
  5:20 PM
Sounds good to me. I can start prototyping, maybe let's have a call tomorrow to discuss it a bit more

returns {"success":true,"message":"Pillar not found","data":null}

@Temi
 
@David

5:23
weird because react appears as one of the options for tags

 i think to bring this to where it should be, we should have decent CV parsing in place, which also guards against malicious pdf and document exploits.
imo it should out of the box use something like https://dangerzone.rocks (edited) 
dangerzone.rocksdangerzone.rocks
Dangerzone
Take potentially dangerous PDFs, office documents, or images and convert them to a safe PDF. (19 kB)
https://dangerzone.rocks/

5:28
but ultimately we dont really care as we should just pass this to the LLM without much fanfare
5:29
The only thing i’m not super keen on is getting spammed with requests and users burning through our AI costs, so i wonder if this should be a payed feature, which would also make the whole platform a bit more sustainable
5:29
wdyt sirs 
@defuera
 
@Matheus Pagani
?
5:31
@Laura
 would like your input on this as well


Laura

@David
 100% we should have security in place and guard against malicious files.
The only challenge around this being a paid feature, is that its very tricky to charge job seekers. We could offer this free, and have a paid dashboard for recruiters to gain visibility of matches OR alerts when a match aligns with a vacancy
5:38
This essentially is a flipped lead gen product. The cost could sit with gaining access to the match
5:39
We also could cap the number of matches allowed in the free, and offer unlimited as paid
5:40
The alert could be an add on to StashPool, on a higher tier bundle you receive alerts when a job seeker matches with your org (edited) 


David
  5:41 PM
cap matches allowed
5:41
where there’s an incentive, there’s a sybil


Laura
  5:42 PM
hmm true


David
  5:42 PM
anyhow, its not like we’re paying a fortune for now
5:42
we can launch it and see how it does and set up a spending cap


Laura
  5:44 PM
we can cap so it's something like 5 matches every 12 hours, something like that. We can say that's all your matches for now, check back later to see if more matches are available
5:44
Otta did something like this

otta?


Laura
  5:48 PM
We should also try to understand the most commonly uses filters, and use these as part key questions when they start the bot.
Preferred tech stack
Preferred chain?
Company size? Start up vs scale up?
This way, we use their personal preference in line with CV when narrowing down options to show. We can show the ones most likely to convert to an application

Laura

Otta is an AI job matching platform


David
  5:48 PM
is otta owned by welcometothejungle?


Laura
  5:49 PM
Ah yeah, they were acquired a year or so ago. No idea why they changed the name, they had a good brand as Otta


David
  5:50 PM
ah, welcometothejungle.. yeah sorry but i’m not importing any learnings from them.
explicitly banned them from jobstash for being rubbish and costing me a week of dev time for nothing


Laura
  5:50 PM
Oooh interesting


David
  5:50 PM
i’ll generalize it and say i refuse to learn anything at all from a french software company
5:50
20 years of software has done this to me
5:50
its not me
5:50
its them


Laura
  5:51 PM
That's handy, I actually got hired through them once - just assumed their tech was sound


David
  5:51 PM
its the opposite
5:52
anyhow. rants aside. :slightly_smiling_face:
5:52
i think that ratelimits are bad, people will circumvent them anyhow
5:52
and if they circumvent we lose tracking
5:52
and we end up with a whole new problem i dont want to tackle, which is reconciling sybilled identities


Laura
  5:53 PM
So,  unlimited matches and we move the cost to a commercial product for recruiters / orgs?


David
  5:53 PM
lets see what it costs first
:100:

Laura
  5:54 PM
Hopefully not a lot, I don't see exceptional candidates paying to find a job
5:54
I think it would end up being the weaker candidates who pay and potentially don't get the desired outcome, but let's see


David
  5:55 PM
i see a few thousand users trying this out per month, which should not be too crazy expensive given current LLM costs
